    "## What is a Pulsar?\n",
    "\n",
    "A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star that emits beams of radiation from its magnetic poles, which are not aligned with its rotational axis. As the stars spin, the beams of radiation hit earth which from our perspective are regular pulses of light\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](pulsar.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The average intensity of these regular pulses known as the mean integrated profile (MIP) of the pulsar can be measured. The MIP contains significantly less noise and variance compared to single pulses reveal a characteristic shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the moments of the MIP eg. 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th moments such as mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis allows us to effectively predict whether or not a star is a pulsar; becoming a binary classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common algorithms that can be used to solve binary classificiation problem is logistic regression which in this report, we wil be implementing from scratch"
